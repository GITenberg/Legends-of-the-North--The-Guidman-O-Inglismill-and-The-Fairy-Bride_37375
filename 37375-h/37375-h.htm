<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<hr style="width: 10%;" />
<p>The <i>Guidman o' Inglismill</i> was written, not to fill up "hours of idleness,"
but as a relaxation from the cares of a more important and arduous occupation.</p>

<p>Its object is the encouragement of temperate habits, and the enjoyment of
"ane's ain fireside."</p>

<p>It is hoped it will be no less acceptable to the reader as another attempt
to assist in preserving the pure Doric of "auld langsyne," which is fast being
superseded by a language less pithy, less expressive, though more fashionable.</p>

<p>Every "toon's laddie"&mdash;or he is no true son of the "bruch"&mdash;however
old, however placed as regards wealth or poverty, or wherever he may be on
this habitable globe, can sympathise with the lines to the spot "where we
were born." There is a charm in the true Buchan dialect to a child of the
district, which neither time, age, nor distance can destroy. When "far awa,"
it falls on the ear like the breathings of some holy melody, and calls up in the
imagination a fleeting panoramic picture of early days, and homes, and play-mates,&mdash;swelling
the heart and dimming the eyes as they try to gaze down the
vista of the past,&mdash;dotted, it may be, with the resting-places of those who
have gone "to the land o' the leal."</p>




<p><br /><br /><br /></p>
<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>The superstition with which the tale is interwoven&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"Of fairy elves by moonlight shadows seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The silver token, and the circled green"&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>has, for unknown ages, and in all countries, been an article of the popular creed.
It is impossible to trace the origin of the belief. Some imagine it has been
conveyed to us by the tradition of the Lamiæ, who took away young children
to slay them, and that this, mixed up with the tales of Fauns and Gods of the
woods, originated the notion of Fairies. Others, that the belief was imported
into Europe by the Crusaders from the East, as Fairies somewhat resemble the
Oriental Genii. It is certainly true that the Arabs and Persians, whose
religion and history abound with similar tales, have assigned the Genii a
peculiar country. Again, Homer is supposed to have been among authors the
originator of the idea, as, in his third Iliad, he compares the Trojans to
cranes when they descend to fight against pigmies or fairies. Pliny, Aristotle,
and others give countenance to the belief in a race of fairies; Herodotus
described a nation of dwarfs living on the head waters of the Nile; Strabo
thought that certain men of Ethiopia were the original dwarfs; while Pomponius
Mela placed them far south. But nobody believed these stories, which
were taken to be either poetical licences or chapters in romance. It is, however,
strange that a race called Obongos, about thirty-six inches high, are mentioned
as existing near the Ashango country by Paul de Chaillu (the discoverer of the
gorilla), in his late work "From the Country of the Dwarfs."</p>

<p>Whatever conjecture may be adopted, it is certain our Saxon ancestors,
long ere they left their German forests, believed in the existence of a kind of
diminutive demons, or middle species between men and spirits, to whom they
attributed performances far exceeding human art. Although we are now a
great literary people, yet, in this description of legendary lore, we are
far behind the Germans; for this is a peculiar style of writing not exactly
fitted for English cultivation, but in which the Germans seem to possess the
faculty of invention and contrivance, together with originality of conception
and power of execution, in such an eminent degree as to leave the legendary
writers of our own and other countries at an immeasurable distance. In fact,
we may search the whole range of English, French, Spanish, and Italian
literature, and there will not be found one author "who dips so deep into the
dark profound," or one who is possessed of that magic wand that can give the
same vitality to the beings of a shadowy world as the Germans, or one who, can
conjure up before the mind's eye, in such enchanting colours, the magical
representations of beings and forms of no mark or likelihood, and with whose
names even we were previously totally unacquainted.</p>

<p>The Fairies of our own land were, on the whole, a genial, frolicsome,
happy race&mdash;occasionally given to mischievous tricks&mdash;benefiting those who
were kindly disposed to them and paid them due honour, but revengeful and
doing harm to those who were differently inclined. They were a kind of
intermediate beings, partaking of the nature of both men and spirits: they had
material bodies and the power of making them invisible, and of passing through
any opening. They were generally, in their natural state, small in stature, of
fair complexion&mdash;hence their name in England; while, for their kind dispositions,
in Scotland they were called "the good people." Says Dr Rogers, in
his work "Scotland Social and Domestic," in which will be found much of
interest regarding "Folk Lore":&mdash;"The forms of the Scottish fairies were
beautiful. The female was a being of seraphic loveliness: ringlets of yellow
hair descended upon her shoulders, and were bound upon her brow with gems
of gold. She wore a mantle of green silk, inlaid with eider-down, and zoned
round her waist with garlands of wild flowers. The male fairy was clad in
green <i>trows</i> and a flowing tunic. His feet were protected with sandals of
silver, from his left arm hung a golden bow, and a quiver of adder-skin was
suspended on his left side. His arrows were tipped in flame. The fairies
feasted luxuriously. The richest viands adorned their boards. They frequented
human banquets, and conveyed a portion of the richest dishes into
their palaces. They were present at funerals, and extracted the liquor and
meats which were presented to the company. Some Highlanders refused to
eat or drink at funeral assemblages in apprehension of elfin interference. Their
habits were joyous. They constructed harps and pipes which emitted delicious
sounds. They held musical processions and conducted concerts in remote
glens and on unfrequented heaths. In their processions, they rode on horses
fleeter than the wind. Their coursers were decked with gorgeous trappings:
from their manes were suspended silver bells which rang with the zephyr, and
produced music of enchanting harmony. The feet of their steeds fell so gently
that they dashed not the dew from the ring-cup, nor bent the stalk of the wild
rose." Their haunts on the surface of the earth were groves, mountains,
wooded dells, by springs, the southern sides of hills, and verdant meadows,
where their diversions were dancing in circles, hand in hand. The traces left
by their tiny feet were supposed to remain visible on the grass, and were called
fairy rings, but are now discovered to be the production of an agaric or
mushroom.</p>

<p>Science, alas! sadly interferes with these fanciful old legends, but not
always without leaving some doubtful explanation of her own.</p>

<p>The unfortunate wight who turned up a fairy ring with the ploughshare
became the victim of a wasting sickness&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i4">"He wha tills the fairy green<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Nae luck again sall hae,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And he wha spoils the fairy ring<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Betide him want and wae,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">For weirdless days and weary nichts<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Are his till his deeing day."<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>The protector of the fairy ring was proportionally recompensed&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i4">"He wha gaes by the fairy ring<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Nae dule or pains sall dree,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And he wha cleans the fairy ring<br /></span>
<span class="i5">An easy death sall dee."<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>The kingdom of Fairyland was supposed to be peculiarly beautiful, somewhere
in the interior of the earth. The Ettrick Shepherd's description of this
fair land is, perhaps, unequalled in Scottish poetry. It occurs in his ballad of
"Bonny Kilmeny," embodying the tradition of the removal, to Fairyland, of
the daughter of a labourer at Traquair, and her restoration to earth a few
weeks after:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i4">"Kilmeny had been where the cock never crew,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Where the rain never fell, and the wind never blew;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">But it seemed as the harp of the sky had rung,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And the airs of heaven played round her tongue,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">When she spake of the lovely forms she had seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And a land where sin had never been;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">A land of love, and a land of light,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Withouten sun, or moon, or night;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Where the river swa'd a living stream,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And the light a pure celestial beam:<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The land of vision it would seem,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">A still, an everlasting dream.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp;&nbsp; * </span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i5">They lifted Kilmeny, they led her away,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And she walked in the light of a sunless day:<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The sky was a dome of crystal bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The fountain of vision, and fountain of light:<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The emerald fields were of dazzling glow,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And the flowers of everlasting blow.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Then deep in the stream her body they laid,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">That her youth and beauty never might fade;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And they smiled on heaven, when they saw her lie<br /></span>
<span class="i4">In the stream of life that wandered bye.<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">

</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i5">She saw a sun on a summer sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And clouds of amber sailing bye;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">A lovely land beneath her lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And that land had glens and mountains gray;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And that land had valleys and hoary piles,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And marled seas and a thousand isles;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Its fields were speckled, its forests green,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And its lakes were all of the dazzling sheen,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Like magic mirrors, where slumbering lay<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The sun and the sky and the cloudlet gray;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Which heaved and trembled, and gently swung,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">On every shore they seemed to be hung."<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Scottish fairies had a king and queen and royal court, which, in pomp and
pageantry, far exceeded that of any earthly monarch. In Poole's "Parnassus,"
the principal persons are named Oberon, the emperor; Mab, the empress;
Perriwiggin, Periwincle, Puck, Hobgoblin, Tomalin, Tom Thumb, courtiers;
Hop, Mop, Drop, Pip, Drip, Skip, Tub, Tib, Tick, Pink, Pin, Quick, Gill,
Jim, Tit, Wap, Win, Nit, the maids of honour; Nymphidia, the mother of
the maids.</p>

<p>At one time, the Queen seems to have chosen Thomas of Ercildoune&mdash;better
known as The Rhymer&mdash;with whom to share her royalty. Whether
from infidelity to her royal spouse, or from his having fallen into temporary
disgrace, tradition sayeth not, but her offer is celebrated in ballad lore&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i4">"An' I will gie to thee, luve Thomas,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">My han', but an' my crown;<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>But, after seven years' residence, he was suddenly dismissed by her majesty,
his mistress, and for a very sufficient reason, as told also in ballad lore&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i4">"'Busk thee, Thomas, for thou must be gane,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">For here no longer may'st thou be;<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"She brought him again to the Eildon tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Underneath the greenwood spray;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">In Huntly banks was fayr to be,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Having thus restored The Rhymer to earth, he was permitted to remain for a
time, to enlighten and astonish his countrymen by deeds resulting from the
knowledge, and by his marvellous prophetic powers, acquired during his seven
years' residence in the Fairyland; still, however, bound to return to his royal
mistress when she should intimate her pleasure. Accordingly, while Thomas
was making merry with his friends in the Tower of Ercildoune, a person came
running in, and told, with marks of fear and astonishment, that a hart and hind
had left the neighbouring forest, and were, composedly and slowly, parading
the street of the village. This being the signal agreed upon for his recall to
Elfinland, the prophet instantly arose, left his habitation, and followed the
wonderful animals to the forest, whence he was never seen to return. According
to the popular belief, he still "drees his weird" in Fairyland, and is one
day expected to revisit the earth. The village of Ercildoune is situated on the
Leader, two miles above its junction with the Tweed, and the ruins of an
ancient tower are still pointed out as The Rhymer's castle. The Eildon tree,
from under which he delivered his prophecies, no longer exists; but the spot
is marked by a large stone, called Eildon Tree Stone; and a neighbouring
rivulet takes the name of the Bogle Burn, from being the spot where The
Rhymer's visitants met him.</p>

<p>Hunting was a favourite sport at the Fairy court. They rode to the hunt
in three bands. The first was mounted on brown horses; the second rode on
grey; while the third, consisting of the king, queen, and chief nobles, sat on
white steeds. One member of the court rode on a black charger: this was
Kilmaulie, prime councillor of Fairyland. Altogether, they seem to have led a
jolly life there, the principal drawback being the liability to pay, every seventh
year, one of their number as a tribute or Kain to hell. This is described in the
ballad of "Tamlane," who, while he relates the delights of his home in Fairyland,
and even, somewhat selfishly, values them higher than the affection
of his true love, fair Janet, does not relish the possible finale in his being made
the Kain to hell:&mdash;</p>

<p>And so the brave Janet, actuated by that greatest of all feelings&mdash;a true
woman's love&mdash;took her lover from the procession on Hallow-e'en, by
"pulling him down" from the "milk-white steed" on which he rode, and
holding him fast in spite of all the "horrible and awfu'" changes he underwent
in her hands, discovering, when he returns to his true likeness, that he is
her old boyish love, son of Randolph, Earl of Murray, whom the fairies had,
years before, stolen away.</p>

<p>There were, as in all communities, a good and a bad section, known as the
"seelie" and the "unseelie court." The seelie court were kind, courteous, and
charitable to the aged, the poor, and the afflicted, to whom they gave gifts
suited to their necessities, as in the rhyme&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">"Meddle and mell<br /></span>

<span class="i6">Wi' the fairy men,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Ye'll thrive until ye dee."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The unseelie court, on the other hand, from those who offended them, stole
their goods and killed their cattle by elf-shot, occasionally found on the moors or
turned up in the fields now-a-days, but which science ruthlessly asserts to be the
arrow-heads of our prehistoric ancestors. They entertained a particular
dislike against those who wore clothing of a green colour. To this cause the
Highlanders ascribed the death of Viscount Dundee at Killiecrankie. But
their most wicked prank of all was the carrying away of handsome unbaptized
children from the side of the lying-in mother, substituting their own loathsome
and sickly progeny in their stead. To prevent this misfortune, it was customary
in the Highlands to perform the Dessil&mdash;that is, carrying fire in the right hand,
and in the direction from right to left, morning and evening, round the house
in which lay the mother and child, until the baptism and churching had taken
place. "This was," says Martin, in his "History of the West Highlands,"
"considered an effectual means to preserve both the mother and infant from
the power of evil spirits, who are ready at such times to do mischief, and
sometimes carry away the infants and return poor, meagre skeletons; and these
infants have voracious appetites. In this case, it was usual for those who
believed that their children were thus taken away to dig a grave in the fields
on quarter-day, and there to lay the fairy skeleton till next morning, at which
time the parents went to the place, where they doubted not to find their own
child instead of the skeleton." They had also, in other localities, recourse to
the barbarous charm of burning, with a live coal, the toes of the suffering
infant, the supposed changeling. They were not content with abstracting
handsome children&mdash;beautiful maidens and wives sometimes disappeared, and,
of course, the fairies were the abductors. The Miller of Menstrie,<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> in Fife,

who possessed a charming spouse, had given offence to the "unseelie" court,
and was, in consequence, deprived of his fair helpmate. His distress was
aggravated by hearing his wife singing in the air&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i4">"Oh! Alva woods are bonnie,<br /></span>

<span class="i4">But, when I think o' the bonnie braes o' Menstrie,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">It mak's my heart aye sair."<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>After many attempts to procure her restoration, the Miller chanced one day, in
riddling some stuff at the mill door, to use a posture of enchantment, when the
spell was dissolved and the matron fell into his arms. The wife of the Blacksmith
of Tullibody was carried up the chimney, the fairies, as they bore her
off, singing&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">"Deidle linkum doddie;<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Those snatched to Fairyland might be recovered within a year and a day, but
the spell for the recovery was only potent when the fairies made, on Hallow-eve,
their annual procession. Sir Walter Scott relates the following:&mdash;"The
wife of a Lothian farmer had been snatched by the fairies. During the year of
probation, she had repeatedly appeared on Sundays in the midst of her children,
combing their hair. On one of these occasions she was accosted by her
husband, when she instructed him how to rescue her at the next Hallow-eve
procession. The farmer conned his lesson carefully, and, on the appointed
day, proceeded to a plot of furze to await the arrival of the procession. It
came, but the ringing of the fairy bridles so confused him that the train passed
ere he could sufficiently recover himself to use the intended spell. The
unearthly laughter of the abductors, and the passionate lamentations of his
wife, informed him she was lost to him for ever." A woman who had been
conveyed to Fairyland was warned, by one she had formerly known as a
mortal, to avoid eating or drinking with her new friends for a certain period.
She obeyed; and, when the time expired, she found herself on earth, restored
to the society of mankind. A matron was carried to Fairyland to nurse her
new-born child, which had previously been abducted. She had not been long
in her enchanted dwelling when she furtively anointed an eye with the contents
of a boiling cauldron. She now discovered that what had previously seemed a
gorgeous palace was, in reality, a gloomy cavern. She was dismissed; but
one of the wicked wights, when she demanded her child, spat in her eye and
extinguished its light for ever. About the middle of last century, a clergyman
at Kirkmichael, Perthshire, whose faith was more regulated by the scepticism
of philosophy than the credulity of superstition, would not be prevailed upon
to yield his assent to the opinion of the times. At length, however, he felt,
from experience, that he doubted what he ought to have believed. One night,
as he was returning home, at a late hour, from a meeting of presbytery, and
the customary dinner which followed, he was seized by the fairies and carried
aloft into the air. Through fields of ether and fleecy clouds he journeyed
many a mile, descrying, like Sancho Panza on his clavileno, the earth far
distant below him, and no bigger than a nut-shell. Being thus sufficiently
convinced of the reality of their existence, they let him down at the door of
his own house, where he afterwards often recited, to the wondering circle, the
marvellous tale of his adventure. Some people <i>will</i> believe that spirits of a
different sort had a little to do with the worthy minister's conviction, and that
his "ain gude grey mare" had more to do with bringing him to his own door
than the fairies. Toshack, the last chief of clan Mackintosh, occupied a castle
or keep on the margin of the river Turret, in Perthshire. He held nocturnal
interviews with a fairy whom he had brought with him from abroad. The
mode of his reaching the place of meeting, and the nature of his companion,
were long a mystery. His wife, at length, became jealous of the frequent
departures of her lord; and, being unable to discover whither he proceeded,
resorted to the scheme of attaching a piece of worsted to his button. Thus
guided, she followed him down a subterraneous passage under the bed of the
river, where, after various windings, she discovered him in conversation with
a beautiful lady. The discovery so enraged the matron that she insisted on the
immediate destruction of the stranger, who fled, and the sun of Toshack set to
rise no more.</p>

<p>With all the passions and wants of human beings, fairies are represented as
great lovers of cleanliness and propriety, for the observance of which they
were said frequently to reward good servants by dropping money into their
shoes; and, on the other hand, punishing the sluts and slovenly by pinching
them black and blue&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>They took particular fancies to certain people and families. Sometimes their
favour was obtained by compulsion, as in the case of Musgrave of Edenhall,
near Penrith, in Cumberland. The legend is, that the butler of the family,
having gone one night to draw water at the well of St Cuthbert, a copious
spring in the garden of the mansion of Edenhall, surprised a group of fairies
disporting themselves beside the well, at the margin of which stood a drinking
glass. He seized hold of it, when the elves took to flight, kindly informing
him, however, as they went, that</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i4">"If this glass do break or fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Farewell the luck of Edenhall."<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>It is still in existence, but had at one time nearly been destroyed by the wild
and hair-brained Duke of Wharton, who let it drop from his hands. The
luck of Edenhall was, however, preserved by the presence of mind of the
butler, who, standing by, caught it in a napkin. Lloyd, a boon companion of
the Duke, wrote a burlesque poem on it, as a parody of "Chevy Chase,"
beginning</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i4">"God prosper long from being broke<br /></span>
<span class="i5">The luck of Edenhall;"<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>and Uhland, the German poet, has a ballad, "Das Glück von Edenhall," on
the same legend. The glass is of a peculiar shape, very thin, and painted
outside with various devices, including the letters "I.H.S." (<i>Iesus Hominum
Salvator</i>). Most probably, it had originally been a chalice used in the chapel
dedicated to St Cuthbert, which stood in the neighbourhood of Edenhall.</p>

<p>Another description of fairy was the brownie&mdash;so called from their complexion&mdash;a
sort of domestic elf, who was extremely useful and performed all
sorts of domestic drudgery, and was repaid by meat, a bowl of milk, or wort,
but who, if offered clothes, departed in sorrow and great distress, returning no
more. At one time, every family of substance had their brownie. Milton, in
his "L'Allegro," describes the brownie, and</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i4">"Tells how the drudging goblin swet<br /></span>
<span class="i4">To earn his cream-bowl duly set;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">When in one night, ere glimpse of morn,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">His shadowy flale hath threshed the corn<br /></span>
<span class="i4">That ten day-lab'rers could not end;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Then lies him down, the lubbar fiend,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And stretched out all the chimney's length,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Basks at the fire his hairy strength,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And crop-full out of doors he flings,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Ere the first cock his matin rings."<br /></span>

<p>Notwithstanding the progressive increase of knowledge, and proportional
decay of superstition in the Highlands, these genii are still supposed by many
of the people to exist in the woods and sequestered valleys of the mountains,
where they frequently appear to the lonely traveller, clothed in green, with
dishevelled hair floating over their shoulders, and with faces more blooming
than the vermeil blush of a summer evening. At night, in particular, when
fancy assimilates to its own preconceived ideas every appearance and every
sound, the wandering enthusiast is frequently entertained by their music, more
melodious than he ever heard. It is curious to observe how much this agreeable
delusion corresponds with the superstitious opinion of the Romans
concerning the same class of genii represented under different names.
Lucretius, an acute philosopher, brilliant poet, and most accomplished disciple
of Zeno, after describing the predisposing causes of <i>echoes</i>, sums up their
effects on uncultivated minds in the following beautiful lines:&mdash;</p>

<p>Sir John Sinclair's "Statistical Account of Scotland, 1792," says:&mdash;"About
eight miles to the eastward of Cailleachbear, a conical hill rises
considerably above the neighbouring hills. It is called Siensluai, the fairy
habitation of a multitude." He adds, in a note:&mdash;"A belief in fairies prevailed
very much in the Highlands of old, nor at this day is it quite obliterated. The
small, conical hill Siensluai was assigned them for a dwelling, from which
melodious music was frequently heard, and gleams of light seen on dark
nights." In the account of the parish of Kirkmichael, we read: "Not more
firmly established in this country is the belief in ghosts than that in fairies.
The legendary records of fancy, transmitted from age to age, have assigned
their mansions to that class of genii in detached hillocks, covered with verdure,
situated on the banks of purling brooks, or surrounded by thickets of wood.
They derive this name from the practice of the Druids, who were wont
occasionally to retire to green eminences to administer justice, establish peace,
and compose differences between contending parties. As that venerable order
taught a <i>saogh hal</i>, or world beyond the present, their followers, when they
were no more, fondly imagined that seats, where they exercised a virtue so
beneficial to mankind, were still inhabited by them in their disembodied state.
In the autumnal season, when the moon shines from a serene sky, often is the
wayfaring traveller arrested by the music of the hills, more melodious than the
strains of Orpheus. Often struck with a more solemn scene, he beholds the
visionary hunters engaged in the chase and pursuing the din of the clouds,
while the hollow rocks, in long-sounding echoes, reverberate their cries.
There are several now living who assert that they have been suddenly
surrounded by visionary forms, have seen and heard their aerial hunting, and
been assailed by a multitude of voices."</p>

<p>But it would be impossible, without very largely extending our limits, to
give other than a meagre sketch of this interesting portion of folk lore. All
our ancient poets and writers of fancy, Scotish and English, dealt largely with
the subject, and quarried from this exhaustless mine. "Spenser was contented
with the fairies of romance, but Shakespeare founded his elfin world on
the frothiest of the people's traditions, and has clothed it in the ever-living
flowers of his own exuberant fancy. How much is the invention of the great
poet we shall probably never be informed, and his successors have not
rendered the subject more clear by adopting the graceful world he has created,
as though it had been interwoven with the popular mythology and formed a
part of it."<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a></p>

<p>With the spread of education and increase of knowledge, the superstitious
belief in fairies has almost died out, except in some very few localities and
among very uneducated people. When the writer was a very young boy, he
was acquainted with an old couple who related to him their having jointly and
severally seen the "good people" in troops enter, in procession, the Castlehill
of Inverugie; and the husband, a worthy, honest man, with the strongest
declarations of verity, described his having spent part of a summer eve lying,
with his ear on the turf, listening to the delighful music which was executed
by the fairy minstrels within the mount.</p>

<p>That such things have been is still believed by many, and there are still
those who assert that their appearance and mischievous exploits have ceased,
or, at least, become less frequent, since the light of the Gospel was diffused in
its purity, or that they have fled before the minister and the schoolmaster.</p>

<h2>THE FAIRY BRIDE.</h2>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>



<h3>THE</h3>
<h2>ROMANCE OF THE FAIRY BRIDE.</h2>
<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>The Peris of Eastern romance are most likely the source from which sprang
the tales of romantic fancy with which our legendary lore abounds.</p>

<p>In the enunciation of the Arabic language the word "Peri" would sound
"Fairy," the letter P not occurring in its alphabet, and would be so
pronounced by the Crusaders in their early intercourse with the Arabs.</p>

<p>In the wreck of Gothic mythology consequent on the introduction of
Christianity, the amiable characteristics of the Peris or Fairies became degraded
amid the mischievous attributes ascribed to subordinate spirits, more unamiable
in their persons and practices, yet more congenial to the habits of thought of
the northern peoples.</p>

<p>In Eastern tales, however vaguely they are described, the females are
uniformly represented as beings of great beauty, amiability, and beneficence&mdash;the
fairest creatures of romantic fancy.</p>

<p>With the early troubadours and minstrels, those nymphs formed the subject
of many a lay, and the fate of their amours, of many a wild romaunt.</p>

<p>The fondness of female fays for human society were fertile themes of
Persian poetry and early European romances, such as "Sir Launfal and Sir
Gruelan," wherein the Fairies of Normandy and Bretagne are endowed with
all the splendour of Eastern description.</p>

<p>The Fairy <i>Malusina</i>, who married Guy de Lusignan under condition that
he should never intrude on her privacy, was of this class. She bore him
many children, and erected for him a magnificent castle by her art. They
lived in uninterrupted harmony until the prying husband concealed himself to
behold his wife in her enchanted bath. When discovered, <i>Malusina</i> fled in
great sorrow, and was never again seen. A humiliating tale, which, <i>if true</i>,
would seem to show that men are quite as curious and inquisitive as women
are popularly supposed to be.</p>

<p>So common was the idea of the union of human beings with the females of
Fairyland in early times, that it was firmly believed the ancestor of the English
monarchs, Geoffrey Plantagenet, had married one of these beings.</p>

<p>In the ballad of "Thomas of Ercildoune," the Queen of Fairyland is
represented as becoming enamoured of True Thomas. Among the Icelanders
the belief was common. Torfaeus, in his history, gives an account of a female
who, having born a child to an Icelander, claimed the privilege of baptism,
and deposited the infant at the gate of the churchyard for that purpose, with a
golden goblet as an offering. The belief is still held by the Laplanders.</p>

<p>The origin of the noble family of Hay dates from a remote period in our
national history. In Normandy there were lands and a lordship denominated
Hay, and in the roll of the adventurers who accompanied William the Conqueror
into England in 1066, Le Sieur de la Haya is expressly mentioned; but
the origin of the Erroll family is thus told by tradition:&mdash;The Danes, having
landed in Aberdeenshire, ravaged the country as far as the town of Perth.
King Kenneth hastened to give them battle, and the hostile armies met on the
Leys of Luncarty, in Perthshire. The Scots at first gave way, and fled
through a narrow pass, where they were stopped by a countryman of great
strength and courage, and his two sons, who had no other weapons than the
yokes of their ploughs, they having been at work in a field not far from the
scene of action. Upbraiding the fugitives for their conduct in flying from the
field, these peasants succeeded in rallying them. The Scots turned upon their
conquerors, and, after a second encounter, still more furious than the first,
they gained a complete victory. It is said that, after the Danes were defeated,
the old man, lying on the ground, wounded and fatigued, cried "Hay, Hay,"
which word became the surname of his posterity. The King rewarded him
with as much land in the Carse of Gowrie as a falcon should fly over before
she settled; and a falcon, being accordingly let off, flew over an extent of
ground six miles in length, afterwards called Erroll, and lighted on a stone
still styled the Falcon Stone. The King also raised him to the dignity of
nobility, and assigned to him and his family armorial bearings in accordance
with the signal service which he and his two sons had rendered to their
country.</p>

<p>"Till lately, indeed," says Lord Lindsay, in his <i>Lives of the Lindsays</i>, "more
especially in Great Britain and north of the Tweed, Genealogy merited the
ridicule which was so freely lavished on her. It is but a few years ago since
the most unfounded fictions were currently believed as to the origin of the
Scottish families. The Stuarts were universally held to be the descendants of
Banquo&mdash;the Douglases of 'the dark grey man,' who fought under King
Salvathius against the Danes. It would be endless to enumerate all the fictions
with which vanity and flattery peopled the blank of time; they are now
forgotten&mdash;all save the beautiful legend of the patriarch Hay of Luncarty, on
which Milton, in his youth, purposed to found a drama, and which has been
immortalised by Shakespeare in the play of <i>Cymbeline</i>."</p>

<p>"Circumstantial evidence," says Pratt, "is also so far in favour of the
traditionary record as to render it hazardous to set it aside as wholly unworthy
of credit. Thus, the <i>Hawkestone</i> at St Madoes, the well-known boundary of
the ancient possessions of the Hays of Erroll in Perthshire, is mentioned by
Boethius as existing in his day (anno. 1500), and as having been set up
immediately after the defeat of the Danes, in 980. Also the <i>Stone</i> so carefully
preserved at Slains Castle, and which from time immemorial has been venerated
by the family as that on which their ancestor sat down after the conflict. For
the origin of these and similar traditions it would be difficult to account, had
there been no foundation whatever for the narrative of Luncarty."</p>

<p>Gilbert de Haya, Regent of Scotland during the minority of Alexander II.,
married a daughter of William Comyn, Earl of Buchan, about 1255.</p>

<p>The old Castle of Slains belonged originally to the Earls of Buchan, and
became afterwards, for many generations, the seat of the Earls of Erroll.</p>

<p>There is some doubt whether the Castle owed its erection to Fergus, who
lived in the time of William the Lion (1065), or to the Comyns who succeeded
to this earldom through marriage with Marjory, only daughter of Fergus, and
Countess of Buchan in her own right.</p>

<p>Again,&mdash;Saladin, the famous Sultan of Syria, fought Guy de Lusignan, King
of Jerusalem, in 1187. Then Phillip Augustus of France, Richard I. of
England, with many others, and among them numbers of our Scottish nobility,
deemed themselves called upon to fly to the rescue of the Holy Sepulchre, and
by a third crusade endeavour to wrest its possession from the infidel.</p>

<p>From these facts considerable doubt arises as to which of the "gallant
Hays" was the hero of the following ballad. It could hardly be Gilbert, who
married the daughter of the Earl of Buchan. If it was, then he could scarcely
have been in the third crusade; and there are grave doubts as to the Lady
Claribel having been the "child of the Elfin Queen." There may, however, be
no doubt that she was beautiful as a Princess, for beauty is no rare qualification
of the ladies of the district; nor may it be improbable that she waylaid and
captured the Hay in one of the many knightly journeyings in search of
adventures which the nobles of those days undertook.</p>

<p>The ladies of those far-off times did many strange things&mdash;at least, what
now-a-days would be considered such; nevertheless, from the ballad it appears
she "made a good wife for all that."</p>

<p><i>It is feared</i>, under all the circumstances, that, as in many other legendary
tales, considerable liberty has been taken with fact in favour of fancy.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i4">Proudly there stood by the rock-bound shore<br /></span>
<span class="i5">A lordly home, with turrets gray;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">But the knight afar in Paynim land<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Had been many a year away.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Merrily dashed the sea-driven foam<br /></span>
<span class="i5">High on the lofty castle wall;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">But the henchmen moved them drowsily,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">For lone, alas! were bower and hall.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">'Twas the hour when wearied daylight sinks<br /></span>
<span class="i5">In the arms of the waiting west,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And gloaming steals from her purple cave,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Bearing her lone star on her breast.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">When the glades like minster windows gleam<br /></span>
<span class="i5">With slanting rays of burnished gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And stealing shadows, in fond embrace,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Are creeping the forest to fold.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">


<span class="i4">Through the dim and faint-lit forest aisles,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Flitting among the grey old trees,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The maiden sped on, each weary sigh<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Mingling with the evening breeze.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">"Oh, would he were come&mdash;the gallant Hay,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Quickly the night begins to fall;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Oh, would that his manly heart were mine,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">And my home were his castle hall."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Brighter anon flashed her bright blue eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Rosier blushed her cheeks, I ween,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">As, breathless, she heard a war-horse tramp<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Through the glade of the forest green.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Then quickly came forth a youthful knight,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Straining his eyes that home to see,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">He'd longed for many a watchful hour<br /></span>
<span class="i5">By the waters of Galilee.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">


<span class="i4">Suddenly halted the courteous knight,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Bright the glance of his martial eye<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Flashed in the light of his manhood's bloom<br /></span>
<span class="i5">'Neath the plume of his morion high.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Marvelled he much as the evening rays<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Fell on a maid so wondrous rare;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">"Art thou a form from the beauty world<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Or the fairest of earthly fair?"<br /></span>

<span class="i4">I've wandered far and lost my way,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">And am wearied and fain would rest."<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Full lowly he bent his waving plume,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Till it mixed with his horse's mane,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">"Where is thy home, dear lady, I ask?<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Let me carry thee thither again."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">


<span class="i4">"Knowest thou, brave knight, where the elfin halls<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Gleam under skies of purple light,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">With their towering domes of chaste opal<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Glowing in clouds of crimson bright;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">With their waving trees of rarest kind,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Soft'ning sunlight cheering the gloom,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Catching the rays as they hasten by,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Wreathing their tops with golden bloom.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"Last eve, with my maids, I left my home,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Singing our songs in gay refrain;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Seeking wild flowers, I wandered alone<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Over hill, over dale, and plain.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Laughingly trod we the dewy mead,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Lit by the rays of the evening star;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">But sadly I've spent the weary day,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">For, ah me! I have wandered far.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">


<span class="i4">"I know not thy home," the young knight said,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">"Else in honour I'd bear thee there;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Tho' never below the glorious sky<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Have I seen one so passing fair.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Much have I mingled in court and camp,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">In revel, in tourney and strife,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">But never, till now, have mine eyes beheld<br /></span>
<span class="i5">A maid I could love as my wife."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Quickly the warrior lighted him down&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i5">"Lady," he said, "my halls are near;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Come to my arms&mdash;I'll carry thee home,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">And ye shall be my peerless fere."<br /></span>
<span class="i4">"Gramercy, my lord," the maiden said;<br /></span>
<span class="i5">"Willingly shall I go with thee;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And I'll be to thee a leal, true wife&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i5"><i>Thou</i> shalt be 'all the world to me.'"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">


<span class="i4">Around her form his arms he flung,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">To kiss her lips so cherry bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">But nothing he held, for the sylph-like form<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Ethereal prov'd as a stream of light.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">"Lady," he said, "this is passing strange!<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Thour't there!&mdash;I see thy curls of gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">I see the flash of thy lustrous eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">But I cannot thy form enfold."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"My form is of air, so virgin pure<br /></span>
<span class="i5">By mortal it cannot be press'd<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Till by the cross of his sword he swear<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Alone I shall dwell in his breast."<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Then he bent him low before the cross,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">And he vowed, by all he held dear,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">That ever he'd prove her own true lord,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">And <i>only</i> she his much loved fere.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">


<span class="i4">"<i>Now</i>, come to my arms, thou beauteous fair,"<br /></span>
<span class="i5">And he grasped her fondly and fast,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Kissing her lips, grown woman again,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Fearing his joy too great to last.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">"I'm thine, only thine, mine own dear lord,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Never again to roam apart;<br /></span>

<span class="i5">Let me live in thine inmost heart."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">He lifted her on the saddle-bow<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Of his gallant roan, standing near,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And proudly it shook its stately head<br /></span>
<span class="i5">As her voice fell soft on its ear.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">In triumph it bore them fleetly home;<br /></span>
<span class="i5">And the liegemen for years could tell<br /></span>

<span class="i5">And his truth and his braverie.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">But more they spoke of his fair, fair bride,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">And her beauty so wondrous bright;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Lighting his halls like the sun's first rays<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Dispersing the shadows of night.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Long, long did they mourn in Fairyland<br /></span>

<span class="i4">Long was she missed in revel and court,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">In palace and bower and dell.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">But oft, when hidden among the flowers,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Watching the lovers in dalliance gay,<br /></span>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
